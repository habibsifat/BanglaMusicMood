# BanglaMusicMood
The aim of this research work is to detect the music
mood of the listener, by analyzing the lyrics of Bangla language
based songs. We used a naive Bayes Classifier as the main feature
to built the music recommendation system, trained the attitude
of songs based on song lyrics to predict. We constructed our
own dataset of 50 Bangla songs consisting Rabindra Sangeet,
Nazrul Geeti, Folk, Modern. We have worked on two types of
bangla moods such as happy and sad, corresponding to the bangla
meaning. At the end of the experiment, our proposed method
performed really well to classify the mood of the song with high
accuracy.
